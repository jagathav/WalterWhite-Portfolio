Say my name... 💥  
This isn’t just a website — it’s a *portfolio cook-up* by Heisenberg himself (okay fine, by me 👨‍💻).

Built with pure HTML, this site was created in a secret digital lab — no chemicals involved, just caffeine and code.

I wanted to mix a little chemistry with creativity, proving that even a chemistry teacher can break bad... into frontend development

🧪 Features:
- 99.1% pure responsive design  
- Cooked fresh using GitHub Pages  
- Smooth animations with zero contamination  
- Guaranteed to leave your CPU asking for “more.”

Remember: I am not in danger, Skyler — I am the developer.
